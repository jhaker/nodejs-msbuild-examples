            Your privacy is an important to us (Teach And Share). We
            take great consideration during the development of each of
            our products and services. We are committed to being transparent and open.
        </div>
        <h4>
            This Teach And Share Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive information
            about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.
        </h4>
        <h2>
            What do we mean by "personal information?"
        </h2>
        For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like
        your name or email address.

        Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

        If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal,
        we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove
        all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is
        non-personal information.

        <h2>
            How do we learn information about you?
        </h2>
        We learn information about you when:

        you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);
        we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g.,
        when your Firefox browser checks with us to see if is up to date);
        someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when Thunderbird
        works with your email providers to set up your account); or
        when we try and understand more about you based on information you've
        given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for
        some of our services).
        What do we do with your information once we have it?
        When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which
        you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help
        us provide and improve our products and services for you.

        <h2>
            When do we share your information with others?
        </h2>
        When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
        For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if
        those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated
        to handle the data in ways that are approved by Teach And Share.
        When we are fulfilling our mission of being open. We sometimes release
        information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when
        we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose
        it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.
        When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive
        requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll
        notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in
        this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive
        requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we
        have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in
        this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that
        you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
        When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else.
        We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith
        belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property
        or safety of you, our other users, Teach And Share or the public.
        If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a
        restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information
        to a successor or affiliate.
        How do we store and protect your personal information?
        We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it.
        We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite
        our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that
        you can take appropriate protective steps.

        We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need
        it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once
        we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by
        law to keep it longer.

        <h2>How do we use cookies and local browser storage?</h2>
        <p>
            Teach And Share uses a technology that is commonly known as
            "cookies." A cookie is a file our server writes to your
            hard drive that contains an alphanumeric identifier.
            We use the identifier in a cookie to help us manage and
            report on your interaction with the Service. Through cookies,
            we are able to collect information that we use to improve the
            Service, keep count of return visits to our website or our
            advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on
            aggregate statistical information, authenticate your login
            credentials, or manage multiple instances of the Service in
            a single browser. We may also collect other data such as the
            page or site that referred you to the Service, the date and
            time you visited the Service, and your current IP address.
            The cookies we place on your hard drive are known as "first-party cookies."

            We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session
            cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent
            cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period
            of time. You may be able to remove persistent cookies by
            following directions provided in your browser's "help" section.
            If you do not accept first-party cookies you may still use our
            Service, but your ability to use some areas of our website, and
            the ability to stay logged in, will be limited.

            Advertisers' and other third parties' use of cookies: Advertisers
            and third-party advertising partners that deliver ads to you on
            the Service may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive.
            These types of non-Teach And Share cookies are known as "third-party
            cookies." Advertisers and third-party advertising partners may use
            third-party cookies in order to collect information about you,
            which may include how many times you have seen their ads or
            whether you have interacted with an ad. They may also use
            third-party cookies to provide you with interest-based advertising.
            Most major web browsers provide users with the option to
            accept or reject third-party cookies. The use of third-party
            cookies is not covered by this privacy policy. We do not have
            access to or control over cookies placed by advertisers and other
            third parties. If you would like to review and modify your
            interest-based advertising settings, visit Your Advertising Choices
            on Teach And Share.

        <h2>
            What else should you know?
        </h2>
        We're a global organization and our computers are in several different
        places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers
        may also be in various countries. This means that your information might
        end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may
        have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving
        us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information.
        No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable
        law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.

        If you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you
        must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your
        child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information, please
        contact us to have your child's information removed.

        <h2>
            What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?
        </h2>
        We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be
        posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update
        through Teach And Share's usual channels for such announcements such as
        blog posts and forums.
